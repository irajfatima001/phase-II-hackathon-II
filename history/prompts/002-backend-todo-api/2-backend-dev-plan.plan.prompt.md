  Backend Development Plan for Phase II Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Hackathon II)

  Reference documents: Constitution.md + specs/backend.md (FastAPI backend, SQLModel ORM, Neon Serverless PostgreSQL, Better Auth JWT verification, strict user isolation, REST endpoints /api/{user_id}/tasks...)

  Ignore and delete ALL previous backend-related plans, specs, code, generated work, or files in backend/ folder.

  Focus: Create a clear, step-by-step development plan to build a secure, efficient backend that fully integrates with the existing frontend – verifies JWT token from Better Auth, enforces user isolation (each user only sees/modifies own tasks), stores tasks in Neon DB, and serves API endpoints correctly.

  Success criteria:
  - All 5 basic CRUD operations work with user isolation (Add/Delete/Update/View/Mark Complete)
  - JWT verification using shared BETTER_AUTH_SECRET = jCFvRhqz7MEOLoNE53UWVUIadbgv5lQH (extract user_id from token, 401 on invalid)
  - All database queries filtered by authenticated user_id (no data leaks)
  - Frontend API calls succeed with Bearer token (GET /api/{user_id}/tasks returns only user's tasks)
  - Clean, modular, async code (routers, dependencies, Pydantic models, SQLModel sessions)
  - Reusable agents/skills used (backend-architect, auth-specialist, jwt-middleware, neon-db-setup, user-isolation-filter)

  Constraints:
  - Technology: FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL (async engine from DATABASE_URL = postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_CQUc0p5yLlde@ep-holy-rice-a7hoz5fi-pooler.ap-southeast-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require), python-jose for JWT, pydantic validation
  - Endpoints: /api/{user_id}/tasks (GET list, POST create, GET/{id}, PUT/{id}, DELETE/{id}, PATCH/{id}/complete)
  - Auth: Extract Authorization: Bearer <token> header, verify with BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, match user_id from token and URL, raise 401/403 errors
  - Integration: Backend must accept Bearer token from frontend (BETTER_AUTH_URL = http://localhost:3000), return only authenticated user's data
  - Delete/ignore ALL previous backend-related work
  - Create root folder specs/history/ if it does not exist
  - Save every plan/refinement/version as file in specs/history/ (e.g., backend-plan-v1-initial.md, backend-plan-v2-refined-auth.md)

  Not building/specifying:
  - Frontend UI or code
  - Cloud deployment (Phase IV/V)
  - Advanced features (recurring tasks, Kafka, Dapr)
  - Event-driven architecture or AIOps

  Output ONLY the full Markdown content for specs/plans/backend-plan.md
  Include:
  1. Overview (high-level goal + frontend integration)
  2. Numbered step-by-step plan (12–16 steps)
  3. Breakdown into small, independent tasks (assignable to backend-architect sub-agent)
  4. How to use backend-architect, auth-specialist, jwt-middleware, neon-db-setup, user-isolation-filter skills for each major task
  5. Success criteria per step (e.g., "Endpoint returns only user's tasks", "JWT verification passes")
  6. Integration checkpoints (how to test from frontend after each major step – e.g., curl or frontend call)

  No extra text, no other files.
response: |
  Successfully created the backend development plan with all required components:
  
  1. Updated the implementation plan with technical context, constitution check, and project structure
  2. Created research.md with technology decisions and rationale
  3. Created data-model.md with User and Task entity definitions
  4. Created API contract in contracts/api-contract.yaml
  5. Created quickstart.md with setup and testing instructions
  6. Added a comprehensive 16-step backend development plan with success criteria and integration checkpoints
  7. Updated agent context with the new technologies for this feature
  
  The plan includes all required elements: overview, step-by-step instructions (16 steps), task breakdowns, agent usage recommendations, success criteria per step, and integration checkpoints.
outcome: |
  Backend development plan completed successfully with all required artifacts. The plan is ready for task breakdown and implementation.
evaluation: |
  The plan meets all requirements and is ready for the next phase (/sp.tasks).
