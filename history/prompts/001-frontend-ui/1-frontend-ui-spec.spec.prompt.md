  $ARGUMENTS
  
  Frontend UI Specification for Phase II Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Hackathon II)
  
  Ignore and delete ALL previous frontend-related specs, plans, code, generated work, or files in frontend/ folder.
  
  Now create a fresh, excellent, professional frontend specification ONLY for Phase II Todo app.
  
  Focus: Build a modern, responsive frontend that integrates with the backend API – implements user authentication with Better Auth, provides intuitive task management interface, and ensures a seamless user experience across devices.
  
  Success criteria:
  - All 5 basic CRUD operations work with proper UI feedback: Add/Delete/Update/View tasks, Mark Complete
  - Authentication flow works with 99% success rate under normal conditions
  - All UI components are responsive and accessible across device sizes
  - Frontend successfully communicates with backend API for all operations (95% success rate under normal load)
  - Page load times are under 3 seconds and interactive elements respond within 100ms
  - 100% of UI components meet WCAG AA accessibility standards
  - All user actions provide appropriate feedback (loading states, success, error)
  
  Reusable agents/skills used (frontend-ui, auth-specialist, jwt-middleware, neon-db-setup, user-isolation-filter)
  
  Use these exact credentials:
  - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET = jCFvRhqz7MEOLoNE53UWVUIadbgv5lQH
  - BETTER_AUTH_URL = http://localhost:3000
  - DATABASE_URL = postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_CQUc0p5yLlde@ep-holy-rice-a7hoz5fi-pooler.ap-southeast-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
  
  Constraints:
  - Technology: Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, Better Auth for authentication
  - Components: TaskCard, TaskForm, AuthButton, DashboardLayout with proper state management
  - Integration: Frontend must pass JWT Bearer tokens to backend API, receive only authenticated user's data
  - Delete/ignore ALL previous frontend-related work
  - Create root folder specs/history/ if it does not exist
  - Save every spec/refinement as versioned file in specs/history/ (e.g., frontend-spec-v1-initial.md, frontend-spec-v2-refined-auth.md)
  
  Not building/specifying:
  - Backend API or code
  - Cloud deployment (Phase IV/V)
  - Advanced features (recurring tasks, reminders, Kafka, Dapr)
  - Event-driven architecture or AIOps
  - Ethical/security discussions beyond user isolation
  
  Output ONLY the full Markdown content for specs/001-frontend-ui/spec.md (with sections: Overview, Components, User Flows, Dependencies, Security & Integration, Accessibility, Error Handling, Success Criteria)
  
  No extra text, no other files.
